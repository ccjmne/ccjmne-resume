In my experience, most of a project's value is derived from adequately identifying and contextualising the problem to answer—this is where I have the greatest impact.\nIn designing systems, I believe that [clarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better) and [elegance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) are key to a lasting significance: I am a stalwart advocate of radical simplicity, and strive for creative solutions that will remain effective and adaptable.",
